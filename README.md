# 📝 Notes

## 🚀 Next Steps in Building the Website

### Step 1. Expand Your Data Models (ERD)
- **Users** (done — roles: admin, customer)  
- **Services** (Wedding Photography, Portrait, Event Coverage, Printing, Editing, etc.)  
- **Orders** (customer bookings/orders with delivery/pickup option)  
- **Photos** (customer uploads + final edited versions)  
- **Gallery** (public marketing showcase by admin)  
- **Payments** (optional: track payment status)  

### Step 2. Add Models + Controllers + Routes
For each entity:
- Define a Sequelize model (`Models/Service.js`, `Models/Booking.js`, etc.)  
- Create a controller with CRUD logic  
- Create a route file (`Routes/serviceRoutes.js`, etc.)  
- Register the route in `app.js`  

**Example Endpoints**
- `/api/services`  
- `/api/bookings`  

### Step 3. Secure Routes
**Customers**:
- Book services  
- Upload photos for editing/printing  
- View gallery & their own orders  
- Choose delivery or pickup  

**Admins**:
- Manage services  
- Approve/manage orders  
- Upload finished photos  
- Handle delivery/pickup logistics  

🔑 Use **JWT middleware** for role-based access.  

### Step 4. Test in Postman
- Register/Login user → get token  
- Test protected routes (e.g., add service, create order)  
- Confirm Neon DB updates with real data  

### Step 5. Build the Frontend
- Customer-facing website + admin dashboard  
- Use **React** (or Next.js)  
- Fetch data from backend API endpoints  

### Step 6. Deploy Free
- **Backend** → Render / Railway  
- **Frontend** → Vercel / Netlify  
- **Database** → already hosted on Neon
